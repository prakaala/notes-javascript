function alpha(first, last ){
	this. first = first;
	this.last = last;
	}

//To add more functions to the functios:
	alpha.prototype.methods = function(){					console.log("Hello World");
			}

var o1 = new alpha("Kurian", "Balane");

o1.methods();

	o1.methods would print hello world;


Here it is an example of adding the method/functionality of the object, which we have created using funciton.
