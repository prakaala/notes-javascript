this is about object data type which is a composite data type in js.

object would have a key and a value pair. A key is identifier and value is one of the primitive data types.

var obj = { 
	name :"Hari";
	age: 43;
	address: {
		city: "Monroe";
		state: "LA";
		zip: 71270;}	
	}

To access the elements of object, we use obj."key"; 
	
Array in js
 it is the indexed data where there are indexes and we put values in it. The values can be any integer, string , boolean, or array itself. 

var x = "adf";
var x = 3;
