Arrays in JS


Arrays are a special type of data structure. Array is a object in JS.
Array have indices which are the key to the value, that we put into it.
To access the array, we use the numbers..
Lets take an example,
  var a = [1,2,3,4];

the empty stuffs in array , or the default are empty, which is undefined in the array..

there is empty stuff if we delete any element of array, just by using delete arr[3]. The index 3 will have undefined value within.


We can have array, objects, functions  within the array.


We can separate the each character of string by the array concept..

var s = "one";
s[0];
s[1];
s[2];
