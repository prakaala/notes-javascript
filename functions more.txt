Use of this keyword to view the global variables in javascript;

We can not delete any literal created with var keyword:


var obj =  {
	name: "Raja",
	age: 12;
	lastname: "Ritu"
};

we cannot delete the obj keyword.. 'however we can delete the obj.name, we can delete obj.age, and obj.lastname.

So variable should be created with var::

Functions:

functions are groups of code, can be called 

We must attach a return statement with a function..
if no return statement is attached, then it will return undefined;


Best Practices:

Reduce the number of global variables
Variables must be created with var keyword

Functions are data>>.

they contain code.
They are executable./ running/ 
they can be passed into onther functions

To pass a function as a parameter:

f3(f);  == this would pass the function code.
f3(f()); == this would give the value.
