Object in javascript
they are name, key value pair..


queue vs stack

The object is created using curly braces:

var obje = {	
	name: 'Kach Toter';
	age: 50;
	address: {
		city: 'Fosterr'	
		state: 'CA'
		country: 'USA'}
	}



To see the code written in the function without invoking it, we just type the name of function. 


arguments is a default array which is created while declaring the function.

We can view the arguments by accessing the arguments keyword in the function.

As we know how js is executed, while the function execution context is created and executed, it will call the argument object: But we can access its elements using array concepts;;
