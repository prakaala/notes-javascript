Functions continued....

First Class Functions

function a(param1){
	console.log('a is called with param: '' param1);
}



We can call a by passing a string number anything..

If we pass anonymous function as a parameter in a. 
Since we are passing function as a value, and we can also return function(){} ,that is called first-class functions.. 

*Note: In any programming language, if function can be passed as a value, then it is called a first class function, first class citizen as well\
