//Code Block
It is something within two curly braces.  It can be nested as well.
{
	var a = 1;
		{							var x = 2;
		}
	var b = 2;
}

best practices, is to put a semicolon at the end.
Indentation is a must.
use of code blocks when needed.


use of ternary operator:
	var a = 4;
	if(a>2)?-"greater than 2": "not greater";

Things to be put into the conditional block;
logical operators like ! && ||;
comparisons like ===, == , !==, !==;
values that can be converted into booleans

Conditionals:

There are control flows which determine the flow of program from one block to another..

var a = 2;
var b = 3;

There are nested conditionals inside the main conditional as well. 

checking if the variable exists or not
We can use typeof operator to check whether a variable exists or not.. before declaring the variable
typeof operator gives undefined which is a string and the code block can be executed or not on the basis of that.

Ternary Operator:

var x = (condition) ? execute this part if true: else execute this part

var a = 1;
var result = (a ===1) ? 'a is one': 'a is not one';


For multiple conditions it is better to use regular if expression
