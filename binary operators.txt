We have to convert a binary into decimal number,
Also convert hexadecimal to decimal number,
and convert octal to decimal number..


The keyword required to convert numbers from different bases to decimal number is ParseInt()..

For binary to decimal:
var a = 1000;
parseInt(a, 2);
var b = 10;
parseInt(b, 2);
So from hexadecimal to decimal, we just replace the base with the base of hexadecimal.


The keyword to convert from decimal to any other bases we use toString() function...

var x = 9;
x.toString(2)
x.toString(8)
x.toString(16)  //this is for hexadecimal



There is an example of converting a decimal to binary and and shift it by number of digits, and converting into decimal again..
We can use the two methods combined as converting into binary and removing the last two digits and again converting into decimal using parseInt(), we get the number..

WE can do the same functunality using an operator..that i.. >> which is the rightshift operator

eg.. 9>>2 = 2;
36>>2 = 9
4555>>2 = 1138;

LeftShift Operator:
We will add two zeroes at the end of binary number converted, and again convert them to decimal:
9<<2 = 1001 ie 100100 that converted to decimal ie 36
