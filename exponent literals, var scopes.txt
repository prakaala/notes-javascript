//Exponent Literals
using the e word to find the exponent of the number

use 1e1
use 2e-3
What is the value of 234.34e-2?
Find the answer

//Infinity is a number that is hard for js to handle

Infinity = infinity
typeof infinity is number
-

The typeof inifinity is a number
the positive number that js can handle is 1e+308;
the number 1e+309 is infinity
The smallest number that js consider is 5e-324;

var a =4/0;
a; is infinity
type of a is a number


Infinity - infinity = NaN
Infinity+/-/*// number = infinity


Not a Number;

typeof NaN is a number feri 

addition , substraction, multiplication, division is not a number


the difference between 

Null and undefined

Undefined is something whose value is not defined in the beginning;
 var x; here the value of x  is not defined
'
null is a special value whose type is null; 


Scope of variables continuedd...

if function is not called, the values declared inside the variable is not defined
if function is called and variable is declared without a var sign then it is a global variable and it can be accessed by using this keyword.


Deleting the variable

we can use the delete varname to delete the variable;
global variables declared without var can be deleted, 

we can even delete object elements using delete statements..
